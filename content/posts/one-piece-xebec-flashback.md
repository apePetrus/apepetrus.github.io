## Thoughts on One Piece's Rocks Xebec Flashback

Dude, this thing is so great.
Since June 23 this year with One Piece chapter 1152, we are having a huge plot on Rocks D. Xebec (or Rocks D. Jones now we know it), learning more of what happened on the God Valley incident, discovering why Garp is not so hypocrite as we thought even if he's a marine and more on Rocks' crew. I got my heart really warming on Rayleigh and Shakki relationship that I almost cried when he saved her. That remembers me when she told the Strawhat's crew that he is always looking for women, but we never saw Rayleigh having that kind of attitude - that is clearly Shakki being totally jealous about him!

### What I expect when we get out of this flashback

Well, it's weird to me that we started with Loki telling us about what happened when king Harald died and we are getting so deep into our new favorite aura farmer lore. So, now that we reached 1166, I expect to see more of Harald post-Xebec and more on Loki until the actual death of the king of giants. I don't know if we are getting much more. I saw a bit of the raws from 1167, but TCB still did not release the translated scans. I know we are having Shanks and Shamrock, but will there be more of them after this?

### What I know we still NEED to see

Definitively more on Dragon's lore and his powers and fruit. Jesus, I can't wait to see this man doing something. We have much more Xebec content than his and I feel so bad about it. The Revolutionary Army and World Government conspiracies are my favorite part of this manga dude!

### Conclusion

I could talk more on this, but I need to sleep now. I'll continue discussing One Piece in future posts, but for now that is just a brief venting and I need to say that I don't want to get back to present days. This entire saga is soooo great!
Bye, guys. See ya later!
