## As the title says

I really dislike this show.

I watched the first episode almost 10 years ago on my English class and I loved it. The first season was amazing, but I was too young so I'm not sure if the script was actually good. Well, the second season I got really hyped up, but it was not good. It was terrible. The third one I watched a bit late, about two or three months after it was released. It was actually decent. The fourth one is terrible and really upset me.

## Always the same character dying

They made Barbara, cute and relatable, and killed her.

They made Bob, good man and relatable, and killed him.

They made the russian guy, cute and relatable, and killed him.

They made Eddie, cool metalhead guy and really relatable, and killed him.

Watching the last season right now. Who is the dying this time? Well, they will be someone just like the four people I just mentioned.

## I will still watch the last season

Well, I grew up watching this and now I see that it has a really lazy direction and I really dislike it. I won't go any further cause I wanted just to vent about the same guy dying every season and it is a mediocre series.

Besides everything, I really love the OST, it's really immersive. I love how they get you immersive into the 80's. There is an amazing atmosphere. The VFX are cool and fight scenes look like they are actually getting hit (differently from almost any other Netflix series).
I will still watch the last season so I can say how much I dislike this shit, lol.

## Enjoy everything even if you hate it

Screw it if the series is bad. I will have fun watching it with my wife, lol.

Bye. See ya another day!
