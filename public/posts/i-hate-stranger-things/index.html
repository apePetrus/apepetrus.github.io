<h1>I Hate Stranger Things</h1>

<h2 id="as-the-title-says">As the title says</h2>
<p>I really dislike this show.</p>
<p>I watched the first episode almost 10 years ago on my English class and I loved it. The first season was amazing, but I was too young so I&rsquo;m not sure if the script was actually good. Well, the second season I got really hyped up, but it was not good. It was terrible. The third one I watched a bit late, about two or three months after it was released. It was actually decent. The fourth one is terrible and really upset me.</p>
<h2 id="always-the-same-character-dying">Always the same character dying</h2>
<p>They made Barbara, cute and relatable, and killed her.</p>
<p>They made Bob, good man and relatable, and killed him.</p>
<p>They made the russian guy, cute and relatable, and killed him.</p>
<p>They made Eddie, cool metalhead guy and really relatable, and killed him.</p>
<p>Watching the last season right now. Who is the dying this time? Well, they will be someone just like the four people I just mentioned.</p>
<h2 id="i-will-still-watch-the-last-season">I will still watch the last season</h2>
<p>Well, I grew up watching this and now I see that it has a really lazy direction and I really dislike it. I won&rsquo;t go any further cause I wanted just to vent about the same guy dying every season and it is a mediocre series.</p>
<p>Besides everything, I really love the OST, it&rsquo;s really immersive. I love how they get you immersive into the 80&rsquo;s. There is an amazing atmosphere. The VFX are cool and fight scenes look like they are actually getting hit (differently from almost any other Netflix series).
I will still watch the last season so I can say how much I dislike this shit, lol.</p>
<h2 id="enjoy-everything-even-if-you-hate-it">Enjoy everything even if you hate it</h2>
<p>Screw it if the series is bad. I will have fun watching it with my wife, lol.</p>
<p>Bye. See ya another day!</p>
