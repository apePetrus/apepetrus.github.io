      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is my first attempt on making a personal blog and being part of an actually human internet. Here is where I can express my thoughts, share ideas and links without being supressed by the weird big tech algorithym that enhances the crapiest form of liquifying your brain with the most stupid content, from dumb memes like tralalelo tralala (well, when I was 10, the MLG illuminati snoop dogg smoke weed everyday brainrot was also pretty good, but now I&amp;rsquo;m grown up lol). There is also some random AI generated articles from actual bots that if you google their name, it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; that makes content about gaming, cooking, politics and sharks (definitly cool, but not a real specialist haha).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
